# Predicting Malware infected windows machines using Machine Learning

* The primary aim of the research is to predict malware infected machines running on windows operating system especially windows 10 based on different software parameters presented in the data. In addition, the research resulted in gaining knowledge about the data analysis Industry. The project aimed to build a good machine learning model for the detection and prediction of malware infected machines. A good model helps in taking necessary actions for preventing malware attacks. Machine Learning models like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM are used in the research. In terms of the performance, LightGBM resulted higher values than other models. This is the first research to explore this type of data and applied LightGBM model in predicting the malware.
